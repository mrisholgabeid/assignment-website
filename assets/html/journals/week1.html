                <h2>DEVELOPING A DIGITAL IDENTITY (DDI):</h2>                
                <p>During week 1 of DDI we conducted and introductory session on the module. We went through the Module Study Guide so that we could have a better understanding of what we should expect from the module and what is expected from us. We were briefly introduced to the languages used in website development and how they are used. We also discovered that we do not have an exam for this module which was a huge relief, but the best part was when we were tols that the assignment is individual and NOT a group assignment which as far as I am concerned was the best news that I heard that day. After we completed the Module Stude Guide and the introductory session there was nothing else to do so we were allowed to leave afterwards.</p>
                
                <h2>INFORMATION SYSTEMS &amp; DATABASES (ISDB):</h2>                
                <p>In this module, we learned about what Information Systems &amp; Databases is related to, what Standard Query Language is and what is expected of us after the semester ends. During the first session, we went over the Module Study Guide (MSG) where we discovered that we have an exam and a group assignment which was the worst news to be honest, however, at least we get to choose our own group members this time, so YAY! On the hand, since I have never done SQL before, I believe that it is definitely going to be very challening. However, I do have a strong belief in myself and my ability to quickly adopt and get used to programming languages, so I know that as long as I have that in mind and good determination then I will be able to pull through. Anyway, after having went throught the MSG and got all the necessary information about the module, we were allowed to leave since no lecture was prepared for this week.</p>
                
                <h2>BUSINESS ACCOUNTING FOR MANAGERS (BAM):</h2>
                <p>We reflected on what we did last year during the <strong>Business Environment</strong> as well as the use of <em>turnitin</em>. We were introduced to how it works after a document/report has been by a student. We learned how to view the feedback of the reports as generated by turnitin and how to use them for future reference. After having went through that, we were introduced to the module as well as what is expected of us by the end of the semester. Assignments were part of the discussion and we were told the we had a single <strong>individual assignment</strong> and an exam, which meant I do not have to go through the hustle of group members. Thank GOD.</p>
